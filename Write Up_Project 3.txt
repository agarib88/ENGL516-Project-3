The purpose of this program is to pull manually annotated chunks of text with tags using REGEX and Python coding. The tags are not specific. 
The characters used for chunking text were brackets [[your text]] followed immediately by double parenthesis ((your tags)). 
What is bracketed or in parenthesis is not relevant to the functioning of the program.
The output are single lines with one annotation and tag.
You need your annotated text file and program in the same folder or pathway.
