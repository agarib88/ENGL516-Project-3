General Description:
This is Group 3 for Project 3. The collaborators in this project are Andrea Flinn, Shuhui Yin, Denise Coberley, and Ali Garib. 
Our project is entitled Qualitative Annotation. This project focuses on previously bracketed texts for sentences/statements of 
interest and the code will pull these sentences/statements from the text and line them up on a new document. 
We will use an Extraction Method for the chunks of texts of interest; that is, sentence extraction. More to be added here...

Instructions for Running the Program:
The purpose of this program is to pull manually annotated chunks of text with tags using REGEX and Python coding. The tags are not specific. 
The characters used for chunking text were brackets [[your text]] followed immediately by double parenthesis ((your tags)). 
What is bracketed or in parenthesis is not relevant to the functioning of the program.
The output are single lines with one annotation and tag.
You need your annotated text file and program in the same folder or pathway.
