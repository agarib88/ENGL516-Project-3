# ENGL516_Project_3
This is Group 3 for Project 3. The collaborators in this project are Andrea Flinn, Shuhui Yin, Denise Coberley, and Ali Garib. 
Our project is entitled Qualitative Annotation. This project focuses on previously bracketed texts for sentences/statements of 
interest and the code will pull these sentences/statements from the text and line them up on a new document. 
We will use an Extraction Method for the chunks of texts of interest; that is, sentence extraction. More to be added here...
