Although problems of understanding have inspired a vast array of studies in linguistics, [[there is much less research]]  ((Establishing a niche_Indicating a gap)) on the instinctive pre-emptive and repair strategies which people use to avoid miscommunication. 
Linguistic data are usually collected from relatively public contexts, leaving one of the most important dimensions of human life [[less explored]]((Establishing a niche_Indicating a gap)): the private sphere. This article [[aims to]]((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)) 
fill this gap by examining both misunderstandings and the ways in which spouses in intercultural relationships achieve understanding. [[The subjects of this study rely on]] ((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively))a common means of communication, a lingua franca, which in their case is English.  Such couples are no longer marginal—increased travel, study abroad, immigration, and the Internet [[have expanded the chances of finding a spouse outside one’s immediate region]]((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)). 

When speakers from different linguacultural backgrounds communicate, [[it is generally expected that misunderstandings will occur.]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations))
Yet, [[research into ELF has found that its speakers demonstrate cooperativeness and willingness to accommodate to their interlocutors.]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations))
[[They detect possibly troublesome turns and use various explicitness strategies]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations)) to overcome problems of understanding.
However, [[some scholars argue that ELF speakers tend to disregard communicational problems]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations)) while appearing to arrive at a shared understanding.
[[This article seeks to broaden general understanding concerning]] ((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)) the extent and causes of misunderstandings in private ELF talk.
[[It also studies the ways in which ELF couples pre-empt miscommunication and facilitate understanding,]] ((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)) and how cooperative these interactions truly are.
