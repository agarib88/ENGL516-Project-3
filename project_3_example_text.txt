Although problems of understanding have inspired a vast array of studies in linguistics, [[there is much less research]]  ((Indicating_a_gap)) on the instinctive pre-emptive and repair strategies which people use to avoid miscommunication. 
Linguistic data are usually collected from relatively public contexts, leaving one of the most important dimensions of human life [[less explored]]((Indicating_a_gap)): the private sphere. 
This article [[aims to]]((Announcing_present_research descriptively_and/or_purposively)) fill this gap by examining both misunderstandings and the ways in which spouses in intercultural relationships achieve understanding. 
[[The subjects of this study rely on]] ((Announcing_present_research descriptively_and/or_purposively))a common means of communication, a lingua franca, which in their case is English. 
Such couples are no longer marginal—increased travel, study abroad, immigration, and the Internet [[have expanded the chances of finding a spouse outside one’s immediate region]]((Announcing_present_research descriptively_and/or_purposively)). 
[m3-S3] In Europe alone, out of over 3 million former Erasmus students, 33 per cent have a partner of a different nationality, and 27 per cent of all Erasmus students have met their long-term partner during their exchange programme. 
As ‘English dominates as the language that Europeans are most likely to be able to speak’, [[the common language of these partners is often English as a lingua franca]]((Definitional_clarifications)).
　　　　
　　　　[m1-S2] When speakers from different linguacultural backgrounds communicate, it is generally expected that misunderstandings will occur. 
[m1-S2] Yet, research into ELF has found that its speakers demonstrate cooperativeness and willingness to accommodate to their interlocutors. 
[m1-S2] They detect possibly troublesome turns and use various explicitness strategies to overcome problems of understanding. 
[m1-S2] However, some scholars argue that ELF speakers tend to disregard communicational problems while appearing to arrive at a shared understanding. 
[m3-S1] This article seeks to broaden general understanding concerning the extent and causes of misunderstandings in private ELF talk. 
[m3-S1] It also studies the ways in which ELF couples pre-empt miscommunication and facilitate understanding, and how cooperative these interactions truly are.
