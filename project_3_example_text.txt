[m2-S1A] Although problems of understanding have inspired a vast array of studies in linguistics, there is much less research on the instinctive pre-emptive and repair strategies which people use to avoid miscommunication. 
[m2-S1A] Linguistic data are usually collected from relatively public contexts, leaving one of the most important dimensions of human life less explored: the private sphere. 
[m3-S1] This article aims to fill this gap by examining both misunderstandings and the ways in which spouses in intercultural relationships achieve understanding. 
[m3-S1] The subjects of this study rely on a common means of communication, a lingua franca, which in their case is English. 
[m3-S1] Such couples are no longer marginal—increased travel, study abroad, immigration, and the Internet have expanded the chances of finding a spouse outside one’s immediate region. 
[m3-S3] In Europe alone, out of over 3 million former Erasmus students, 33 per cent have a partner of a different nationality, and 27 per cent of all Erasmus students have met their long-term partner during their exchange programme. 
[m3-S3] As ‘English dominates as the language that Europeans are most likely to be able to speak’, the common language of these partners is often English as a lingua franca.


When speakers from different linguacultural backgrounds communicate, [[it is generally expected that misunderstandings will occur.]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations))
Yet, [[research into ELF has found that its speakers demonstrate cooperativeness and willingness to accommodate to their interlocutors.]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations))
[[They detect possibly troublesome turns and use various explicitness strategies]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations)) to overcome problems of understanding. 
However, [[some scholars argue that ELF speakers tend to disregard communicational problems]] ((Establishing a territory_Making topic generalizations)) while appearing to arrive at a shared understanding.
[[This article seeks to broaden general understanding concerning]] ((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)) the extent and causes of misunderstandings in private ELF talk. 
[[It also studies the ways in which ELF couples pre-empt miscommunication and facilitate understanding,]] ((Presenting the present work_Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively)) and how cooperative these interactions truly are.
